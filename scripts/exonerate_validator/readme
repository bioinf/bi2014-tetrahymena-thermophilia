This script is used to filter exonerate gff output based on the following conditions:
1) First codon in CDS should be start codon or tripplet before CDS in dna should be start codon (ATG)
1) Length of coding sequence should be divisable by 3
2) There should be stop codon after the end of CDS (for Tetrahymena only TGA)
3) Number of stop codons inside CDS should be zero
Results of checking these conditions for each entry in gff file are reported to stdout. If all conditions are met, gff entry is copied to <filtered-gff> file
After all gff entries are analyzed, total number of gff entries and number of included gff entries are reported to stdout

Usage: python filterGff.py <genome> <gff> <filtered-gff>
Report will be directed to stdout
